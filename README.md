Here’s a descriptive preview of what I did in my Python analysis of the Spotify tracks dataset:
	
1.	Importing Necessary Libraries:
I start by importing key Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization. These are essential tools for working with and analyzing datasets.
	
2.	Loading the Dataset:
I upload the Spotify tracks dataset (CSV file) to my Google Colab environment and load it into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows me to work with the data in an organised, table-like structure.

3.	Exploring the Data:
	•	Display the first few rows to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
	•	Use functions like info() and describe() to check column types, data ranges, and summaries of numerical fields.
	•	Identify missing values in the dataset to ensure data quality before analysis.

4.	Trend Analysis Over Time:
	•	I check if the dataset includes a release date column. And convert it to a datetime format to analyze trends over years.
	•	Group the data by year to calculate average popularity scores.
	•	Create a line graph to visualize how track popularity has changed over time, helping to identify patterns or significant shifts.

5. 	Language-Based Trends:
	•	Generate a bar graph to compare how popular tracks are across languages, focusing on the 7 languages with the highest average popularity.

6.	Data Visualization:
Throughout my analysis, I use various types of plots, including line graphs and bar charts, to make insights visually engaging and easier to interpret. These visualizations help uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.

7.	Key Findings and Insights:
By completing this analysis, I identify trends over time, understand how popularity varies across languages.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

•	Clean and prepare data for analysis.

•	Explore trends and patterns in a large dataset.

•	Use Python’s data analysis and visualization tools effectively.
